# Mine-Robot-kgp
This repository contains the code and robot design for a working prototype of a mine detector robot using an infrared sensor.
This project was completed under the Winter workshop programme at IIT Kharagpur. 

The simulation can be viewed at https://www.tinkercad.com/things/aWM2VzyosOg

The robot is designed to travel in a zig-zag path accross a set area. It can detect walls using an ultrasound sensor and change directions accordingly. On detecting mines using the IR sensor, it stops for a specified amount of time and indicates the presence of the mine by the LED light.
